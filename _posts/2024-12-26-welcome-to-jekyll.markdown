Hi there!
There's no better time to start writing a blog than last week of December. I've done blogging in past but after the surge of social media I stopped, I don't know why!

I deeply believe that blogging is more personal and gives better way of sharing your thoughts and life updates.

I'm not a fan of Medium, so Github pages was the best option.

I'm using the default template 'minima' and writing this blog using **Typora**

I hope I'll keep sharing my thoughts here, so stay tuned!

Cheers,

Ram
